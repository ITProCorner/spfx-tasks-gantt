## Features

Gantt Chart web part that uses a SharePoint Tasks list. This project is still very much in development and is missing some important features:

- User images. When a user is assigned a task their image should appear in the chart inside the task row. Right now there is only a dummy image
- Dependency lines. There should be dependency lines between tasks in the chart, indicating what tasks are dependent on one another.

Some other general UI tidy up is necessary.
